"""Content dispatcher — routes URLs to resolvers by priority order.

Priority (highest to lowest):
1. TwitterResolver  — twitter.com / x.com (must come before WebpageResolver)
2. YouTubeResolver  — youtube.com / youtu.be
3. GitHubResolver   — github.com repos
4. ImageResolver    — image file extensions
5. PDFResolver      — .pdf extensions
6. VideoResolver    — video file extensions
7. WebpageResolver  — generic HTTP(S) pages
8. FallbackResolver — last resort (always matches HTTP(S))

The dispatcher tries resolvers in order and uses the first one where
``can_handle()`` returns True. If the selected resolver raises (which it
shouldn't — resolvers must catch exceptions internally), the dispatcher
catches it and returns an error_result.
